---@module 'lib.cross_plattform.uv.spawn_command'
--- Cross-platform shell command runner for Neovim/Lua.
---
--- This module provides a helper function `spawn_project_command` that executes shell commands
--- in a way that works reliably across platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and correctly handles
--- project-relative paths, especially in Node.js projects.
---
--- Features:
--- 1. Detects platform and automatically selects the appropriate shell:
---    - Windows: `cmd.exe /c`
---    - Linux/macOS: `/bin/sh -c`
--- 2. Supports absolute or project-relative paths for the working directory.
--- 3. Pipes stdout/stderr to Neovim by default, but allows custom `stdio` configuration.
--- 4. Provides an `on_exit` callback for asynchronous process completion handling.
---
--- Usage scenarios:
--- - Running `npm run dev` inside a Node.js project folder, with cwd automatically resolved.
--- - Executing shell commands relative to a project root (absolute or relative path).
--- - Cross-platform scripting without needing to manually handle Windows `.cmd` files or shell specifics.
---
--- Design decisions:
--- - On Windows, `uv.spawn` cannot execute batch files or shell syntax directly. Wrapping commands
---   with `cmd.exe /c` ensures that scripts and shell features work.
--- - On Unix systems, many executables are direct binaries or scripts with shebangs, so they
---   can often be executed directly. Wrapping with `/bin/sh -c` provides consistency.
--- - cwd handling allows commands to be run relative to a project root or Neovim buffer directory.
--- - stdout/stderr piping and callback mechanism make this suitable for asynchronous usage
---   in Neovim or CLI utilities.

---   args: string[]|nil - extra arguments appended to cmd
---   stdio: table|nil - uv.spawn stdio configuration
---   on_exit: fun(code:number, signal:number)|nil - callback when process exits
