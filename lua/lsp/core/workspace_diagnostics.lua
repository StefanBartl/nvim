---@module 'lsp.core.workspace_diagnostics'
---@brief Runtime-toggleable gate for workspace-diagnostics.nvim's populate on LSP attach.
---@description
--- workspace-diagnostics.nvim loads every file of the current repo into
--- buffers on LSP attach (`git ls-files`) to populate diagnostics
--- workspace-wide. That is expensive in large repos — see lsp/init.lua for
--- the incident that made this toggleable (a 60-90s startup freeze in a
--- ~600-file non-code repo). The startup default is still gated there by
--- machine role (off on the "workstation"); this module turns the gate into
--- a LIVE switch on top of that default, so it can be flipped without
--- restarting Neovim — e.g. to turn it off during a "just researching/
--- browsing" phase on a dev machine, or on briefly on the workstation for a
--- one-off deep dive into a smaller repo.
---
--- `lsp.core.attach`'s on_attach reads `enabled()` on every attach (not a
--- value captured once at startup), so a toggle takes effect for the NEXT
--- LSP attach (new buffer, `:LspRestartHere`, ...) — it does not
--- retroactively populate/depopulate buffers already attached. Use
--- `populate_now()` for an immediate one-off populate of the current
--- buffer's clients regardless of the toggle state.
---
--- ## Why this module also owns HOW the populate runs
---
--- The upstream plugin's default `workspace_files` is expensive in three
--- separate ways, all of them on the main loop inside `on_attach`:
---
---   1. two synchronous `vim.fn.system` calls (`git rev-parse` + `git
---      ls-files`) -- on Windows with EDR/AV in the loop, that alone is a
---      three-digit millisecond cost;
---   2. `vim.fn.filereadable()` plus `vim.filetype.match()` for EVERY entry
---      the repo returns (~2600 in this config);
---   3. one `vim.defer_fn` per matching file, each doing a synchronous
---      `vim.fn.readfile()` of the whole file to build a `didOpen`.
---
--- Measured effect: a 300-420ms stall right after `LspAttach`, plus a long
--- tail of 1700+ deferred callbacks. See docs/ROADMAP/PERF-Startup-Analyse.md.
---
--- So `schedule_populate()` below replaces the plugin's file discovery with
--- `lib.nvim.fs.collect_recursive.files_async` (no subprocess, prunes ignored
--- subtrees, filters by extension while walking). It also defers the whole
--- thing off the attach path, and refuses to populate at all above
--- `max_files` -- the size gate that the machine-role default in lsp/init.lua
--- could only approximate.
---
--- ## Why the populate itself is no longer the plugin's
---
--- It used to hand that finished list to
--- `workspace-diagnostics.populate_workspace_diagnostics`. It no longer does,
--- because that path threw on every LSP attach once any file in the list had
--- been deleted or renamed:
---
---   E484: Can't open file <path>     (from a vim.schedule callback)
---
--- Two plugin-internal caches cause it, and neither is reachable from here:
--- `_workspace_files` memoizes the file list on first use and is never
--- invalidated, and its per-file `vim.fn.readfile()` is unguarded. So a file
--- removed mid-session stays in the list forever and raises once per missing
--- file, per attach, for the rest of the session. Clearing the plugin's
--- module state (`package.loaded[...] = nil`) would also wipe its
--- `_loaded_clients` guard and re-send every `didOpen` on each attach, so
--- that is not a fix either.
---
--- What the plugin actually contributed at that point was ~20 lines of
--- `didOpen` notifications, which `send_did_open()` below now does directly
--- -- guarded, chunked, and with the list re-checked as it is consumed. That
--- also resolves the multi-client caveat this module used to carry: each
--- client now populates from its own list instead of inheriting whichever
--- one attached first.
---
--- User-facing commands live in lsp.usercmds.workspace_diagnostics.

--- Tunables for the populate path. `extensions` is what the workspace walk
